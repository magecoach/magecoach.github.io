    <h3>What's the deal with the Penguin and Iceberg?</h3>
    <p>Our mascout the Penguin is the icon of the open source project called Linux, and a strong foundation we believe in. And it just looks friendly! <br/><br/>The iceberg is more like a metaphor, it stands for the 80/20 rule. Regarding Magento performance: 80 Procent is related to the Magento frontend, while 20 procent is server related. So <strong>Magento Frontend Performance optimization</strong> is an important job! Run, Analyze and Fix.</p>
